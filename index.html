        <h2> Hello World, I am Austin Mckee </h2>
        <p> I am currently located in the Portland,Oregon metro area. I am born and raised in Oregon growing up in the Tigard Tualatin 
            School District. I graduated from Tigard High School in 2017 and have stayed in Oregon since then.
        </p>
        <p> Some background on me: 
         I am a former Portland State Student that studied Computer Science and has the equivalent credits to a Computer Science minor.
         Current ThinkFul Engineering Immersion Student who has completed the Node.js section and is currently learning React.js.
          Current Lead Software Engineer for Startup <a href="https://www.raedam.co/about">Raedam</a> which is a company that provides
          a modern solution to how people find parking.

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> I was a student at Portland State University but after this last year in a Covid-19 world,
           I decided joining Thinkful might be a better option to get where I want to be. 
           I love programming and the problem solving that goes with it. I am currently working with a 
           group on a Startup where we are working together to make a solution for parking. I currently am 
           able to provide help with making web apps and am hoping to learn from my time at Thinkful more
           skills to provide to potential employers.
          </p>
        <p>Outside of web development, I am very interested in technology in general, especially the world of computer science. 
          I am a pretty big gamer and sports fan in my free time also. I own an Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and Gaming Pc even though I primarily 
          use the Xbox and Pc.
